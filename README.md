# The Impact of Certificate-of-Need Laws on Heart Failure and Heart Attack Outcomes.

### Background:

Certificate-of-need (CON) laws impose bureaucratic costs to healthcare providers in 35 American states. These regulations require healthcare providers planning on opening a new healthcare facility, expanding a current facility, or purchasing medical equipment to first show to a regulatory body that their region needs the service. 

### Objective:

This project estimates the impact of open heart surgery CON laws and cardiac catheterization CON laws on heart failure, heart attack, and coronary artery bypass graft outcomes. 

### Methods:

I apply a two-way linear fixed effects model controlling for several potential omitted variables to estimate the impact of CON laws on heart related health outcomes. 

### Software Utilized:

Stata and ArcGIS.

### Results:

N/A

### Conclusion:

N/A
